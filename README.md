Responsive Web Design Certification Projects
-I have completed the following projects as part of my learning journey in HTML and CSS on freeCodeCamp:

-Responsive Web Design Certification: I have learned the languages used to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

-Cat Photo App: First, I built a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS.

-Penguin and Quiz Site: Later, I learned modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by creating a quiz site.
